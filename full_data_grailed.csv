Our climber-designed Nano Puff® insulation remains a modern classic: sleek, lightweight and
warm. Worn as an outer or midlayer, these jackets and vests block wind, shed snow and trap
heat—even when wet. Insulated with synthetic PrimaLoft® Gold insulation (60-g) with a 100%
recycled polyester shell that’s treated with a DWR (durable water repellent) finish, they are free
of bulk and super compressible. We recently improved the shape and fit, resized the brick quilt
pattern, and added a soft, wicking interior storm flap and zipper garage. Styles stuff into their
own zippered chest pockets (with clip-in loop). Elasticized cuffs on the jackets and drawcord
hems on both pieces seal in warmth. Regular fit. (Logo left chest.) Made in Vietnam.

Excellent used condition, without any defects!
